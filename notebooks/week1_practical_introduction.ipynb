    "- package dependencies for projects can vary wildly, creating environments clean makes them smaller and more efficient and helps with reproducibility\n",
    "- some packages you will want to use have specific combinations of package versions for other packages that they depend on. This makes it impossible to have one environment for all your projects.\n",
    "- environment specifications can be copied (to create a new version based on an existing one) and (importantly) shared with others.\n",
    "- specifying explictly the package environment makes it very easy to set up containerised projects (Docker, Singularity etc.). These are in effect full image clones of your setup that you can release (for example) with a paper or when working with other groups around the world.\n",
    "- cond environments in particular can handle both ```conda``` and ```pip``` installation which is important because conda only contains a subset of packages so you often need to blend the two.\n",

    "### Which should I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros of Conda:\n",
    "1. **Cross-Language Support**: \n",
    "   - Conda supports not just Python, but other languages like R, Ruby, Lua, and more, making it versatile for multi-language projects.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Binary Package Management**:\n",
    "   - Conda installs pre-compiled binaries, which simplifies the installation of complex libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow) that would otherwise require compiling from source in `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dependency Management**:\n",
    "   - It is better at resolving complex dependencies, preventing issues like conflicting library versions. This is particularly useful in scientific computing and data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Broader Package Availability**:\n",
    "   - Conda’s package repository, Anaconda, includes many data science and machine learning packages that may not be available or easily installable through PyPI alone (which `venv` relies on).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Environment Isolation**:\n",
    "   - Conda creates fully isolated environments, including Python itself, unlike `venv` where Python is shared across environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Platform Independence**:\n",
    "   - Conda environments work well across different platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows), and the package binaries are often optimized for the platform, reducing compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons of Conda:\n",
    "1. **Larger Disk Space**:\n",
    "   - Conda environments tend to be larger in size compared to `venv` because they bundle the entire Python interpreter and all dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Package Availability and Speed**:\n",
    "   - Some packages may take longer to appear in the Conda repository, or may not be available at all, whereas most Python packages are immediately available via PyPI for `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Slower Installation**:\n",
    "   - Installing packages and creating environments can sometimes be slower in Conda, particularly because it attempts to resolve dependencies more rigorously.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Learning Curve**:\n",
    "   - Conda introduces new commands that may take time to learn if you're used to Python's built-in tooling like `pip` and `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros of venv:\n",
    "1. **Lightweight**:\n",
    "   - Since it uses Python’s built-in virtual environment system, `venv` environments are generally smaller, as they do not bundle the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direct Integration with Python**:\n",
    "   - `venv` is part of the Python standard library, so there’s no need to install additional tools like Conda. It integrates seamlessly with `pip` and PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Faster Setup**:\n",
    "   - Creating virtual environments and installing packages with `venv` is often quicker, especially when you’re dealing with simple projects or pure Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standard for Python Projects**:\n",
    "   - Many Python projects and environments default to `venv`, which can make it easier to work within standard Python practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons of venv:\n",
    "1. **Python-only**:\n",
    "   - `venv` only works for Python environments and does not support other languages. If you’re working on multi-language projects, this could be limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **More Manual Dependency Management**:\n",
    "   - You need to manually handle dependencies and package version conflicts, which could become tedious with complex environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Installing Non-Python Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - If a Python package has non-Python dependencies (like C libraries), managing those dependencies can be harder with `venv` compared to Conda."
